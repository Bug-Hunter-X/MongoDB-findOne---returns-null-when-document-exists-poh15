# MongoDB findOne() returns null when document exists

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using the `findOne()` method in MongoDB: unexpectedly receiving `null` even when a matching document appears to exist.

## Problem

The provided JavaScript code uses `findOne()` to query a MongoDB collection. Despite a document seemingly matching the query criteria, the method returns `null`. This can be misleading and lead to debugging challenges.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining the query, connection details, and data structure. The corrected code includes additional checks to handle potential errors and improve clarity.
